## A classic Simon game 

#### Gameplay
The page has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is activated. A round in the game consists of activating one button at random adding it to the game sequence, after which the player must reproduce the sequence from the start of the game. As the game progresses, the sequence increases. The player loses if he clicks on a button that it's not in the correct sequence.
