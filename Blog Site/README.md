## Blog Site

A blog-like site. The 'contact' and 'about' pages display only placeholder text, whereas the 'home' page displays the posts in reverse chronological order. The longer posts have a 'Read More' link that directs to the post page. The post creation is possible through the '/compose' route, which has to be manually typed in the url.

### Project's objectives
